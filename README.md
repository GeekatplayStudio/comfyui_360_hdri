## 📦 Installation

### 1. Install ComfyUI
Ensure you have [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) installed.

### 2. Clone Repository
Navigate to your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` folder and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeekAtPlay/ComfyUI_Blender_toolbox
```

### 3. Install Dependencies & Models
This suite contains standard nodes and the advanced AI PBR Extractor. The standard dependencies are installed automatically by ComfyUI Manager.

For a manual installation, use the Python interpreter that launches ComfyUI:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Version 2.0 requires Python 3.10 or newer. Restart ComfyUI after installing or upgrading.

### API authentication

Add a **Credential Manager (OS Keyring)** node and use its **Save credential** button. Secrets are stored by the operating-system credential vault (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, or the configured Linux Secret Service), not in workflow JSON.

Recommended credential names are `Meshy`, `Tripo`, `HiTem3D`, and `Ollama Cloud`. Connect the manager's `api_key` output to the corresponding service node. Existing `geekatplay_keystore.enc` credentials are migrated to the OS vault once and the old file is renamed with a `.migrated` suffix.

Tripo can also read `TRIPO_API_KEY` from the environment. Ollama requires no key for a local `http://localhost:11434` server; direct `https://ollama.com` access accepts a connected API key.

#### **Required AI Models**
Some workflows require specific models to be placed in your ComfyUI folders.

| Model | Path | Description | Download |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PBR Extractor** | `models/ubsoft_pbr/chord_v1.safetensors` | Generates PBR maps (Albedo, Normal, etc). | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Ubisoft/ubisoft-laforge-chord) |
| **360-HDRI LoRA (Flux)** | `models/loras/human_360diffusion_lora_flux_dev_v1.safetensors` | For generating 360° panoramas with Flux. | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/ProGamerGov/human-360-lora-flux-dev) |
| **360 Redmond (SDXL)** | `models/loras/360redmond_sdxl_v1.safetensors` | The best 360° panorama LoRA for SDXL 1.0. | [Civitai](https://civitai.com/models/118025/360redmond-a-360-view-panorama-lora-for-sd-xl-10) |
| **Seamless Texture LoRA** | `models/loras/seamless_texture.safetensors` | For Flux seamless tile generation. | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/gokaygokay/Flux-Seamless-Texture-LoRA/tree/main) |

**⚠️ Note on PBR Extractor (Ubisoft CHORD):**
The `chord_v1.safetensors` model is **Gated**.
The automatic installer will *attempt* to download it, but if it fails (due to lack of HuggingFace Login), you must:
1.  Go to [Ubisoft LaForge CHORD on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Ubisoft/ubisoft-laforge-chord) and accept the license.
2.  Download `chord_v1.safetensors` manually.
3.  Place it in your ComfyUI folder at: `ComfyUI/models/ubsoft_pbr/chord_v1.safetensors`.

**IMPORTANT: To enable the PBR Extractor (Ubisoft CHORD), you must run the installer manually:**

**Windows:**
Double-click `installer\install_pbr_extractor.bat`.

**Manual / Linux / Mac:**
```bash
python installer/install_pbr_extractor.py
```

> **License Note**: The Ubisoft CHORD model is gated. You must accept the license at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Ubisoft/ubisoft-laforge-chord).
> If the installer fails to download the model due to authentication, download `chord_v1.safetensors` manually and place it in `ComfyUI/models/ubsoft_pbr/`.
